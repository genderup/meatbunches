# Meatspace Bunch

## This is the story of a bunch of meats

Meatspace Bunch is just a silly collection of gifs pulled from [https://chat.meatspac.es](https://chat.meatspac.es).

## Pull requests welcome.

### Setup

```
npm install
npm install -g supervisor
```

To do local development, make sure to change line 3 of `client.js` to `http://localhost:[PORT OF YOUR CHOOSING CHOOSE WISELY]`. Next, configure `app.js` to run on the chosen port (it runs on port 80 by default). Use `sudo supervisor app.js` to start a server that'll watch for changes to the folder.

## To Do

Would be neat if you could curate and share a meatbunch page.
